# RS-B665-Remote-Control

Browser-based remote control of a Technics RS-B665 Cassette Tape Deck using a Raspberry Pi/Node-RED/relays.

Requires hardware hacking of the cassette deck - soldering a lead onto the control panel's connector to the main board and replicating the internal resistor chain to create appropraite REW/PLAY/FF/STOP signals to the deck.
